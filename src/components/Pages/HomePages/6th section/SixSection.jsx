          People love web and native apps for different reasons. React lets you
          build both <br />
          web apps and native apps using the same skills. It leans upon each
          platformâ€™s <br />
          unique strengths to let your interfaces feel just right on every
          platform.

          With React, you can be a web and a native developer. Your team can
          ship to many
          <br /> platforms without sacrificing the user experience. Your
          organization can bridge <br />
          the platform silos, and form teams that own entire features
          end-to-end.
